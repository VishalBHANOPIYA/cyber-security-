- **Password length** makes it harder to crack.
- **Complex passwords** are more secure.
- **Passphrases** (e.g., `ILove$Cyber@2025`) are memorable and strong.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds extra protection like OTPs or biometrics.
- **Password managers** help store and generate strong passwords.
- Avoid **reusing passwords** across different accounts.
