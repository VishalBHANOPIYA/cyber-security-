🔍 ANALYSIS OF PHISHING INDICATORS:

1. ⚠️ Spoofed Sender Email:  
   - Real Amazon domain is `amazon.com`, but here it's `amaz0n-secure.com`.

2. 🔗 Fake Link:  
   - The URL uses a "0" instead of "o" in "amazon", a trick to mislead users.

3. ❗ Urgent/Scary Language:  
   - “Your account is at risk!” and “permanently suspended” adds panic.

4. 📛 Generic Greeting:  
   - Starts with “Dear User”, not personalized.

5. ✍️ Grammar Issues:  
   - Slightly awkward phrasing — signs of low-quality phishing mail.

6. 🔐 No verification through official Amazon app or domain.

✅ Conclusion:  
This email is fake and meant to **trick users into clicking a malicious link** and entering their login details.

Never trust URLs with misspellings, and always verify sender domains.
