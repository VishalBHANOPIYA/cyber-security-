# 🛡️ Task 8: Working with VPNs

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect privacy, secure communication over public networks, and evaluate their performance through practical implementation.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 🔐 **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)**
- 🖥️ **Kali Linux** (for all commands & testing)
- 🌍 [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) – to verify IP before/after
- 📸 Screenshots – for IP check & VPN terminal output

---

## 🪜 Steps Performed

1. ✅ Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account.
2. 📥 Installed ProtonVPN CLI using terminal on Kali Linux.
3. 🔌 Connected to a VPN server (I selected **Netherlands**).
4. 🌐 Verified IP address before and after connection using:
   - `curl ifconfig.me`
   - [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
5. 🔒 Visited secure websites (HTTPS) to check encrypted browsing.
6. 📶 Disconnected and checked difference in browsing speed.
7. 📚 Researched VPN protocols, encryption, benefits & limitations.

## 📎 Connection Status

- ✅ ProtonVPN connected successfully via CLI
- 🌍 Server Location: **Netherlands**
- 🔐 Protocol: **OpenVPN (AES-256-CBC)**
- 🌐 New IP Address: `185.xxx.xxx.xxx` (masked real IP)

📸 **Included Screenshots**:
- `ip-before.png` – Original IP address
- `ip-after.png` – IP after VPN connection
- `vpn-connected-terminal.png` – ProtonVPN CLI output

## 📘 What I Learned

- VPNs encrypt all internet traffic, protecting from ISP, hackers, trackers.
- They help mask real IP address and allow safe browsing in public networks.
- Free VPNs are good for basic use, but can limit speed & server choice.
- Encryption protocols like **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** make VPNs secure.

## ❓ Interview Q&A

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| What is a VPN? | A Virtual Private Network that securely tunnels internet traffic. |
| How does a VPN protect privacy? | It encrypts data and hides your IP address. |
| VPN vs Proxy? | VPN encrypts all data; Proxy only works at app level and isn’t encrypted. |
| What is VPN encryption? | It secures traffic using protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard. |
| Can VPNs ensure complete anonymity? | Not completely, but they improve privacy significantly. |
| VPN Protocols? | OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec, L2TP, PPTP |
| VPN Limitations? | Speed drop, limited servers on free plans, legal blocks in some countries. |
| VPN effect on speed? | VPN causes slight latency due to encryption overhead. |

## ✅ Outcome

> This hands-on task helped me practically understand the importance of VPNs in digital security. I successfully connected to ProtonVPN on Kali Linux and verified encrypted IP masking. It enhanced my understanding of protocols, encryption, and real-time VPN behavior.
